# SoundCloud Desktop Client

------------

## Attention
This client works with WebView2, so it consumes a lot of RAM (~800 MB).
If you want better cross-platform client, use [this](https://github.com/richardhbtz/soundcloud-rpc "this client")

> Why did I made this? 

Because [Richards client](https://github.com/richardhbtz/soundcloud-rpc "this client") isnt working with my proxy and I wanted to recrode my previous repository
